# Introduction to gr-owc

## Overview
The main contributions of gr-owc include a set of custom GNURadio blocks for optical wireless communications (OWC), example flowgraphs, and detailed documentation for deploying physical instantiation of an OWC system. We first introduce some of the custom GNURadio blocks within gr-owc. These blocks can be categorized as follows:
* **Channel Models for OWC:** 
* **Basic Mod/Demod Blocks for Pulsed OWC:**
* **OFDM Enhancement Blocks for Optical-OFDM:**
